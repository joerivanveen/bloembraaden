_Let‚Äôs make stunning websites._

When you know html, css and vanilla javascript,
and you know how to realise your vision with them,
you can take advantage of Bloembraaden to build your websites.

You can build a website **exactly** the way you want,
simply substituting content for standard template tags.
Logic and representation are strictly separated,
which opens up fresh approaches for dynamic websites.

Your client can edit the content of their website through an easy interface,
laid over their website, that you can configure as well as change the appearance of.

## How-to

Check out our [how-to](https://how-to.bloembraaden.io/) website.

## What does it do

Bloembraaden is an elegant cms that serves ‚Äòsingle page apps‚Äô using templating.
It does not force anything on you, there are no ‚Äòthemes‚Äô, you will start from scratch.

It provides the backend / cms for your client.
Bloembraaden integrates with [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/) (other payment providers on request), [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io), Cloudflare‚Äôs [Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/) (to protect your forms) and [MyParcel](https://www.myparcel.nl).

One Bloembraaden installation can serve many websites, each one as unique as the other is baffling.

## Docker

Since the beginning of 2023 I have been using a [docker image to run Bloembraaden][bloembraaden-docker].

# Note to self
The rest of this readme is more or less a giant **note to self**.
Until more people start using it the documentation will probably remain sketchy.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you want to try out Bloembraaden.
I can set it up for you quickly or give you access to my own sandbox install.

## Prerequisites

Bloembraaden needs a vps to run and a connection to a postgres database on that vps or somewhere else.
On the vps you need two websites, one for Bloembraaden itself and one for the images, that will serve as a cdn replacement (currently no existing cdn is supported).
Contact me if you need any help setting up.

## Configuration
Rename `config-example.json` to `config.json` and fill in your own data.

### Version and settings
- VERBOSE when set to true will output debugging information both in the logs as well as in the browser console.
It will also serve fresh css rather than compress it into the \<head>. Note: for the client this value is set when you publish the templates.
- version: must be the current running version.
- upgrade: when set to true, Bloembraaden will check whether an upgrade is necessary. This mechanism will be improved in the future.
When you have no upgrade to install just set it to false.

### Api keys
Bloembraaden uses the following services:
- Instagram
- Browserless (to create pdf‚Äôs)
- Mailchimp transactional e-mail

You can also use Mailgun or Sendgrid, 
but that code is not maintained at the moment and does not allow attachments yet.

### Writable folders
You need to have several folders on your server writable by the web user (e.g. nginx).

The following folder needs to be **as fast as possible**.
- cache (where table info will be cached)

The following may be slower e.g. on a separate disk if you find that comfortable.

Writable folders for:
- uploads
- invoice
- cdnpath 

Point to those folders in the config.

## Web server
Set up a webserver. We recommend NGINX.
We use php-fpm with php 8.2 (8.0 is the minimum version for Bloembraaden).
You can have it process index.php at all times, Bloembraaden will determine what content to show.

Set up two virtual hosts, one for Bloembraaden and one for static files.
Point to the static files in the config, both the path on the server `cdnpath` (that is the root of the virtual host) as the location on the internet `cdnroot`.
You can optimise that virtual host for static files, only images will be served by it.

Bloembraaden saves all images as webp with fallback to jpg (same filename, but .jpg extension in stead of .webp).
If you need this fallback, you should configure it in the static site.

It is recommended to put Bloembraaden (the bloembraaden folder) outside the webroot.
In the webroot the following is needed:
- A `robots.txt` file.
- A `favicon.ico` file.
- The `index.php` file that will serve the websites.

Set up your webserver to serve the `_front` folder from bloembraaden when `_front` is requested from the webroot. Alternatively, you can use a symlink.

The index.php file only has to require bloembraaden/Web.php like so (point to the place where you have put bloembraaden obviously):

```
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/../bloembraaden/Web.php';
```

For the robots.txt file sane content would be:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /__admin__
Disallow: /__shoppinglist__
Noindex: /__action__
```

### Async operations
Many operations such as mailing and database cleaning are performed asynchronously. These are handled by the files `Daemon.php` and `Job.php`.
Please set up a crontab for the web user (e.g. nginx) like so:
`crontab -e -u nginx`
And put in the five lines that are currently needed for Bloembraaden:
```
*/1 * * * * php /path/to/bloembraaden/Daemon.php 0 > /dev/null 2>&1
*/1 * * * * php /path/to/bloembraaden/Job.php interval=1 > /dev/null 2>&1
*/5 * * * * php /path/to/bloembraaden/Job.php interval=5 > /dev/null 2>&1
4 * * * * php /path/to/bloembraaden/Job.php interval=hourly > /dev/null 2>&1
0 3 * * * php /path/to/bloembraaden/Job.php interval=daily > /dev/null 2/&1
```
Regarding the ‚Äòinterval‚Äô: on CentOS the interval=1 is magically translated into $_GET, on Debian / Ubuntu it is not,
on those systems just fill in the value, the Job.php file will interpret it as the interval value.
Ensure that `php` works for you, put in the path to the php executable otherwise.

#### Daemon
The daemon script will run continuously to handle cache and such.
You can force the start of a daemon to watch the output live (it is logged as well) by issuing a command:
`php /path/to/bloembraaden/Daemon.php force`
Note the ‚Äòforce‚Äô parameter, without it the daemon will stop and do nothing because you already have one running, presumably.
Should multiple daemons be running at the same time for whatever reason, the older ones will notice this within a few seconds and commit suicide.

### Clients‚Äô websites
Your clients‚Äô websites‚Äô assets will reside under a folder `/_site` in the webroot, e.g. `/_site/example`.
Each website must contain a `script.js` and `style.css` that will be compiled by bloembraaden.

You can configure 2 optional files:
- `editor_config.json`, the configuration of the editor for this instance.
- `example.mo` (and .po if you wish), the translation file for all generic texts. Use PoEdit to generate it from the code.

The website itself is build with simple templates that you put in the admin interface.
You also point to the `/_site/example` folder through that admin interface.

#### Known bugs
The templating engine has 2 known bugs:
1) If you define two regions that are exactly the same (in compressed html), only one is processed.
Just add a css class to one of the regions to have them differ and process correctly.
2) The detecting of nested tags fails in some complex situations where the same tags are repeated on the page.
Unfortunately there is no workaround, this has to be fixed. Working on it.

### SSL
Both static and the Bloembraaden site / vhost must use ssl. Bloembraaden does not work without ssl.
When you add sites in the Bloembraaden admin, currently you need to configure their ssl separately on the server.

## Database
Use a postgres database, preferably with pgbouncer. You need to create two databases: ‚Äòmain‚Äô for the cms itself, and ‚Äòhistory‚Äô for the history (obviously).
You can name them how you want and just put the connection parameters in the config.

The connection string is optimized for pgbouncer and reuse of connections.

The ‚Äòhistory‚Äô database grows larger but is seldom used, only for ‚Äòundo‚Äô operations and to check for old slugs that are accessed.
Bloembraaden manages the indexes on the databases for optimum performance.
At this point there are still some queries that do not use an index, we are working on identifying them and optimizing further.

### New relic
You can install new relic on your server and Bloembraaden will use it to report errors and stuff.
You don‚Äôt have to set up anything, Bloembraaden checks for ‚Äòextension_loaded‚Äô.
However, you **must** switch off the browser ‚Äòauto instrument‚Äô feature in newrelics .ini file, because it is incompatible with the Bloembraaden javascript compilation.

## Initial install
The first install is done after you have prepared your config file and the two databases, as well as your webserver.
Set `install` to `true` in the config and go to:

`https://your_main_domain.tld/?admin_email=name@domain.tld&admin_password=difficult`

üëç since 0.16.x you can provide the following ENV variables in lieu of the insecure querystring and just visit `https://your_main_domain.tld/`

    BLOEMBRAADEN_ADMIN_EMAIL=name@domain.tld
    BLOEMBRAADEN_ADMIN_PASSWORD=difficult
    MAIN_URL=your_main_domain.tld

Bloembraaden will contact the database and set up a first ‚Äòinstance‚Äô.

‚ö† Please use an actual difficult password.
Do not forget these credentials, because you will not be able to log in without them.

Go to `https://your_main_domain.tld/__admin__/` and login with the credentials you just provided.
You should now switch off the ‚Äòinstall‚Äô flag (set it to `false`).

### Now what?
The ‚Äòinstance‚Äô (website) is empty. This can be daunting. I prefer to consider it liberating.

I will post some ‚Äògetting started‚Äô info on https://how-to.bloembraaden.io in the future.
